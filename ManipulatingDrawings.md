# Manipulating Drawings

#### Scaling and Resizing

##### Scaling with Drag Handles

When you select a drawing a set of 8 drag handles will appear around the perimeter. Clicking and dragging with these handles will scale your drawing freehand. When doing this you can also note the width and height in the toolbar updating accordingly.

##### Scaling with Toolbar

When you select a drawing, you can accurately scale using the width and height using the toolbar values.

##### Resizing with Shape Properties

Using the Shape Properties dialog will resize the shape (note this is different from scaling). Using this will maintain corner radius proportions.

#### Corner Radius

##### Shape Properties

You can easily set a corner radius in the Shape Properties dialog box. This will set the radius relative to the width and height in Shape Properties. If you try to scale the image with the toolbar or drag handles, the corners will skew accordingly. However resizing with the Shape Properties width and height will maintain the radius as set.

#### Placement

##### Toolbar

You can quickly and accurately place your drawing to specific points in your working area including Page Center, Upper Left or Right, Lower Left or Right or Laser Position. After selecting your drawing click on the placement toolbar icon and select your location.
