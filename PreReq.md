# Requirements

## Minimum Computer System Requirements

LightBurn will run on Windows 7.0 or later, 32 or 64 bit, MacOS 10.11 or later, or 64 bit Linux.  LightBurn does not require a powerful computer for most work, though if your designs contain a lot of images, more memory is helpful.



LightBurn talks to many different kinds of lasers.  If you aren't sure what yours is, this guide may help:
